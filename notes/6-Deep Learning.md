# Deep Neural Networks

Neural networks is in the heart of Deep Learning. They are composed of perceptrons, that take inputs and outputs a value of one or zero.

Each perceptron has a boundary line with equation

> w1x1 + w2x2 + b = 0

We can also simplify by calling W and x vectors W = (w1, w2) and  x = (x1, x2), so:

> Wx + b = 0

Each training point has a label y that can be 0 or 1 that we are trying to predict. Å· is the prediction. So
